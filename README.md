What is Lynx?
----------------

Lynx is an experimental digital currency that enables instant payments to anyone, anywhere in the world. Lynx is also a fork of Kittehcoin using the latest stable release of Litecoin as of December 24th 2017. Lynx is a downstream version of Litecoin.
Lynx uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried out collectively by the network. Lynx Core is the name of open source software which enables the use of this currency.

Development Process
-------------------

The `master` branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed to be
completely stable. Lynx Core will regualarly pull changes accepted into Litecoin Core `master` at regular intervals.

Testing
-------

While testing Lynx is encouraged, very few changes to the upstream Litecoin code are implemented, as seen in our commit history. The few changes made to this downstream version warrant testing, of course, but please consider direct bug reports to be reported to Litecoin Core.
